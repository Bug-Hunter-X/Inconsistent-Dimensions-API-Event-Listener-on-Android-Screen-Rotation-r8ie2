This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that the `Dimensions` API's `addEventListener` method doesn't always trigger when the screen orientation changes, leading to inaccurate dimensions being used in the app's layout. This can manifest as UI elements being cut off, overlapping, or misaligned when the device is rotated.
